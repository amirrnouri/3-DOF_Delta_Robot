# Abstract
This project presents kinematic analysis, verification, and workspace generation for the trajectory planning purpose of a 3-DOF Delta robot. The Delta robot was designed and built by Tavan Resan company on an industrial scale. Analytical solutions to the manipulator's inverse and forward kinematic problems are provided and verified in Simscape simulation, and Also practical tests were taken. The manipulator's workspace is generated using the discretization method, and the impact of the manipulator's different properties on the workspace was investigated. Robot's singular points were determined and checked whether they were in the practical workspace, considering platform and joint limitations. The practical workspace determines space boundaries where the trajectory of the manipulator's end-effector should be planned. At last, trajectory planning was implemented with different methods in order to make the manipulator's end-effector movement as smooth as possible for pick-and-place operations. Also, Experimental tests were executed to observe the robot's behavior and verify the equations.
